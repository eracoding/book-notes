# API

Api is the acronym for application programming interface.
An API is a set of functions and procedures for
creating applications that access the features or data of an operating system,
application or other service. 

API types:
1. Browser API
2. REST API
3. Sensor-based API


In Software development,
API's are often the bridge between different components or systems. 
1. DOM API turns the html document into a tree of nodes that
are represented as JavaScript objects. 
2. Geolocation API that returns coordinates of where
the browser is located. 
3. Fetch API - fetching data
4. Canvas API - drawing and graphics
5. History API - about history
6. Client side storage - Web Storage API

### RESTful or REST API - is critical type of API for web development.

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) - is a set of principles that help build highly efficient API's.

One of the main responsibilities of these kinds of API's is sending and
receiving data to and from a centralized database.
We can query our own REST API or third party ones.

For web developers the most common data API is a RESTtful API which
as you've learned is a web server that provides responses to requests.
These API web servers are designed to provide the data backbone for
a web client like a web page or mobile app.
This means that these API's must be able to accomplish things like getting data or
get, creating data.
Also referred to as post updating data or put and deleting data or delete.
API issues, REST principles and
good design practices to create discoverable interfaces. 

### Sensor-Based API
This is what the internet of things also known as IOT is based on.
These are actual physical senses that are interconnected with each other.
The sensors can communicate through API and track and respond to physical data. 

### IDE
Integrated development Environment is software for building applications. An IDE is just like a text editor except instead of writing documents you're writing code.
